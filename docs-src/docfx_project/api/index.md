# API Documentation
API documentation is available for RestModels here. Classes are broken down by namespaces and are mostly grouped together by their position in the <xref:request-flow>. If you're just building an API, the class you're probably most interested in is <xref:RestModels.Options.Builder.RestModelOptionsBuilder`2>.
